#### Summary:

I interned at <a href="https://www.simcoachgames.com/" target="_blank">Simcoach Games</a>, a game studio that creates transformational learning games for their local Pittsburgh clients. 
During my internship, I developed 2 mobile games: “Reinforcers” and “JobPro: Get Hired!”.  

For gameplay videos, *scroll to the bottom!*  

I was a gameplay engineer and worked closely with a producer, game designer and an artist to meet the goals of our two local clients:
1. “Reinforcers” client: 
    - <a href="http://www.cawp.org/" target="_blank">Constructors Association of Western Pennsylvania (CAWP)</a> & <a href="https://www.laborpa.org/" target="_blank">Laborers’ District Council of Western Pennsylvania</a>
    - Goal - Use the game to raise awareness of available construction jobs and increase application rates
2. “JobPro: Get Hired!” client: 
    - The Three Rivers Workforce Investment Board (rebranded to <a href="https://www.partner4work.org/" target="_blank">Partner4Work</a>) 
    - Goal - Teach proper interview behavior to the unemployed or struggling youth

#### Scope:

15 weeks | 4 person team | C#, Unity

#### My Contributions:

1.	Developed algorithms to detect different touch gestures such as swiping, circling, tapping, etc.
2.	Parsed and read Excel & Google Spreadsheet files (.CSV, .TSV) so game designers can easily modify content outside of scripts
3.	Adapted the games for both web and mobile platforms
4.	Incorporated an in-game replay, review and evaluation system for player performance
5.	Collaborated daily with a lead artist, game designer, producer, and clients

#### Results:

Published both games on Apple and Android stores:  
- Reinforcers --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simcoachgames.reinforcers&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Android</a>  |  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reinforcers-cawp-arcade/id1016478101" target="_blank">Apple</a>  
- JobPro: Get Hired! --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simcoachgames.gethired&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Android</a>  |  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jobpro-get-hired/id1036998640" target="_blank">Apple</a>  

Both games have positively influenced Pittsburgh’s communities
1. Reinforcers
    - I handed off Reinforcers to our client and they loved it! It is now a part of their apprenticeship program’s mini-games which can be found <a href="https://www.futureroadbuilders.com/skill-arcade/" target="_blank">here</a>
    - The game has helped improve our client’s construction job application rates and 100s of players have earned certificates since June of this year
2. JobPro: Get Hired
    - The Three Rivers Workforce Investment Board released the game to the public as part of a suite of games
    - Community-based organizations now use it to prepare troubled teens and young adults for jobs
