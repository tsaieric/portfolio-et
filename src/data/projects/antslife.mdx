#### Summary:

A single player journey where you lead your fellow ants to find food by steering your leaf. Enjoy the 2.5D perspective and art but don’t let too many of your buddies die from natural hazards

#### Goal:

Tell a compelling, meaningful interactive story where the guest has some ability to interact in order to bring the story to a fulfilling climax

#### Limitations:

3 weeks | 5 person team | C#, Unity3D

#### Contribution:

Implemented fluid group movement through autonomous AI steering. Manipulated PS Move’s rotational input to simulate natural steering. Implemented billboarding. Utilized Unity’s particle systems to simulate rolling fog and falling raindrops.
