For 5 months, I worked as a gameplay programmer with 5 classmates on a research project 
for Electronic Arts to explore their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-connected-tv-a-major-opportunity-for-gaming/1100-6397145/" target="_blank">Connected TV platform</a>. 
The Connected TV platform allowed mobile devices to communicate with computer/tv applications through JSON messages using a Node.js server.

Our goal was to explore how voice recognition could be used to encourage children to read through the platform.  

This video is an intro to the project.

For this project, I:  

1. Wrote a Unity MVC framework to help convert and add existing childrens books into our project
2. Implemented karaoke highlighting of words by parsing a spreadsheet of dialogue times and manipulating the word text when read
3. Animated and brought storybooks to life through Unityâ€™s animation system and key framing
4. Simplified the animation process by making relevant functions more modular so that they could be called during the key framing process
5. Programmed gameplay logic for communicating and sending messages between the mobile controller and the Unity application

Unfortunately, EA abandoned the Connected TV platform and the project was discontinued. 
Nonetheless, I believe the game design and execution had a lot of potential. 
We playtested with local Pittsburgh schools several times and the kids enjoyed the experience thoroughly.
