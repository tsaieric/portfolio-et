I wrote a Unity project that demonstrates A* pathfinding and steering behaviors. 
I enjoyed working on these functionalities because they are simple yet powerful. I've embedded 2 videos & described my work below:

### A* Pathfinding
This video above shows A* pathfinding using a grid setup in Unity. In the scene, ten zombies are all simultaenously using A* to constantly calculate their paths to the player.

To reduce lag and improve runtime, I:
1.	Spread the processing of each zombie into separate frames to avoid lag from computing all paths on 1 frame 
2.	Utilized my own Priority Queue class to better handle the retrieving of the Node with the lowest F-cost
3.	Used HashMaps to reduce the cost of checking if a node was contained in open or closed sets
4.	Only recalculated paths if the target moved to a new node or location

I found it exciting to be able to see the paths of each zombie change as the player moved around various obstacles!

### Autonomous movement 

This video shows autonomous behavior through calculation of steering forces. 
Steering is done by calculating the force required to achieve a desired movement behavior for any AI character.  

All movement was handled through calculations of acceleration, velocity and position. 
Unityâ€™s collision detection was also turned off to prove the AI is calculating obstacle avoidance vs. relying on the physics engine.

I implemented many behaviors such as:
1.	Seeking towards a target
2.	Fleeing from a target
3.	Wandering randomly
4.	Avoiding Obstacles

Look at the <a href="https://github.com/tsaieric/BasicMovement/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/BasicMovement/MoveController.cs" target="_blank">MoveController.cs</a> for the behaviors mentioned.  

Look at the <a href="https://github.com/tsaieric/BasicMovement/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/BasicMovement/FlockingAnchor.cs" target="_blank">Flocking Anchor.cs</a> to see algorithms for shape-based flocking.
